Youâ€™ve already learned that PowerShell cmdlets all produce objects as their output.
When you run a remote command, its output objects need to be put into a form that
can be easily transmitted over a network. XML, it turns out, is an excellent way to do
that, so PowerShell automatically serializes those output objects into XML. The XML is
transmitted across the network and is then deserialized on your computer back into
objects that you can work with inside PowerShell. Serialization and deserialization are
really just a form of format conversion: from objects to XML (serialization), and from
XML to objects (deserialization).
