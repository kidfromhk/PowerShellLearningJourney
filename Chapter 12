Above and beyond
PowerShell v3 introduced a new “simplified” syntax for Where-Object. You can use
it only when you’re doing a single comparison; if you need to compare multiple items,
you still have to use the original syntax, which is what you’ve seen in this section.

Folks debate whether or not this simplified syntax is helpful. It looks something like
this:
Get-Process | where WorkingSet -gt 100MB

Obviously, that’s a bit easier to read: it dispenses with the curly brackets {} and
doesn’t require the use of the awkward-looking $_ placeholder. But this new syntax
doesn’t mean you can forget about the old syntax, which you still need for morecomplex comparisons:

Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.WorkingSet -gt 100MB -and $_.CPU -gt 100}

What’s more, there are years’ worth of examples out on the internet that all use the
old syntax, which means you have to know it to use them. You also have to know the
new syntax, because it will now start cropping up in developers’ examples. Having to
know two sets of syntax isn’t exactly “simplified,” but at least you know what’s what
